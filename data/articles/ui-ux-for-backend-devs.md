# UI/UX for backend devs
## Fundamentals
- White space
- Color
- Contrast
- Scale
- Alignment
- Typography
- Visual Hierarchy

## Notes
### White Space
padding, margin, line-height, start big, awkward big, make it smaller till it seems OK

### Color
Start with 2 / 3 main colors.
Use Variations of the same Hue, with different Saturation and Brightness

### Contrast
Check design against contrast (AA or AAA WCAG 2.0)
Design is also about accessibility and readability

### Scale
Most important elements should stand out with proper scaling.
Lines should not be too long, just comfortable for reading.

### Alignment
Text and elements should be aligned against each other.
Even if they look intentionally random, they need to be in the "grid". The human brain likes order.
E.g. 
- the background of one paragraph is longer than usual, but the text is in line with other paragraphs and headings, or
- three items aligned to left, first with 2rem, second 6rem, third 4rem (multiple of 2rem used as indent)

### Typography
Check typography libraries, and typical typography of elements on the web.
Typography usually should somehow follow the usual headings, paragraphs, quote tags, etc.

### Visual Hierarchy
Elements around the main element should gradually fade to propagate the important one.
Headings, paragraphs, cards, forms, sliders, all have their purpose.
